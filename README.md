# SUPPORTIVE-SYSTEM-FOR-PARTIALLY-PARALYZED-PATIENTS-WITH-HEALTH-MONITORING-CAPABILITIES.
The most common causes of paralysis are serious accidents or severe head injury or spinal cord injury. In most cases, people who are affected by paralysis are not able to convey their needs to their guardians or family members due to a loss of motor control by their brain. In this way, the supporting system of partially paralyzed patients truly automates the caretaking ability of the patient which ensures timely attention to the patient and the good health of the patient. This system is designed to convey the basic needs of partially paralyzed patients to their guardians through the message to their phone numbers based on the hand gesture of the patients which is measured with the help of MPU-6050 (micro accelerometer and gyro sensor). This system is also designed to monitor the patientsâ€™ vital health parameters such as heart rate and oxygen saturation (SPO2) with the help of MAX-30100(pulse oximeter sensor).
